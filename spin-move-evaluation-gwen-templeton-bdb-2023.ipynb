Using a pass rusher's orientation and angle  of motion as they move agaisnt the offesnive linemen we can approximate based on change of orientation and angle of motion the type of pash rush move used including the spin move. For example a play with a pass rusher going up on x and not much change in motion or orientation we can assume it's more of a straight bull rush on the olinemen. \n\nFor a spin move if we create a change orientation by taking the current frameId's orientation, the 5th previous frameId orientation, and substracking the two.Similary we can do the same with direction.  Now we have the player's movement over 5 frames. \n\nNow to set boundries to what it means to do a spin move. Orientation is measured as a circle so 10 degrees and 360 degrees is only 20 degree change.So that is kept in mind by max change in orientation of 300. In order for a player to do a complete spin a players shoulders and body will change orientation at a estimation of at least over 250 degrees So we will go little over with 260 in order to make sure spin is done, 180 could be an indicator but also doesn't fully tell if a player went all away with their spin or if they stopped. \n\nIn order to try to take in account defender running past a QB and turning back into them like a spin, a limit is placed on change in direction to less then 90 to help combate those incidents ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
